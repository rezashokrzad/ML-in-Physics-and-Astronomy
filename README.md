# ML-in-Physics-and-Astronomy
This repository is provided to store the final project of machine learning in physics and astronomy.

The project is simulating an event in which two subatomic particle is collided and generate two new particles. This kind of simulation is so helpful for physicians to avoid doing several experiments in reality like what is happening in Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 
In this project, Monte Carlo sampling technique, smearing the samples, and a generative model (VAE) are applied.
